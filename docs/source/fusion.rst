About *fusion*
==============
The `fusion` package provides common methods to perform data integration
commonly referred to as `data fusion`.  Enriching a data set with external
information can often lead to improvements in modeling accuracy as well as
more insightful analyses.  Having these tools readily available will streamline
this processes and allow data fusion to become a more common task within
data science.


What is Data Fusion
-------------------
Data Fusion is the process of integrating multiple sources of information
about a population collected through some measurement process.  In a marketing
setting, this typically involves combining panels or other population samples
with the goal of enriching the overall behavioral knowledge.  Usually a new,
more robust data source is then created that can be used for more granular
targeting or more accurate predictive modeling.

In general, given data sources A with variables X, Y and B with variables X, Z
the goal of data fusion is to make inferences on the joint but unobserved data
 X, Y, Z.
