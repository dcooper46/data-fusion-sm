    "For instance, consider a purchase prediction model built using purchasing behavior. Television ads are known to affect purchasing behavior, so it may be helpful to include tv viewing behavior or ad viewing history in the model to improve accuracy.  This information is measured in a separate data source.  Fusing the purchasing data with the viewing data will create a more robust and informative data source to train the prediction model on, improving its accuracy/usefulness.  \n",

    "In this example, we join an online behavior survey to a tv viewing panel.  The tv panel doesn't have viewing behavior in this example, but some useful characteristics that are not measured in the survey.  Also, the tv panel doesn't have Income as a measured feature, but the survey does.  It would be useful to share information across these sources to enrich aggregate insights derived from either."
