data-fusion-sm
==============

`data-fusion-sm` is a generic framework for the fusion of multiple data sources using statistical matching techniques.  The objective is usually to study the relationship between variables not jointly observed in a sample.

It is geared towards use cases from the
marketing industry and social sciences, where *data fusion* and *statistical matching* are synonomous and the typical data under study
comes via panels, surveys, or similar longitudinal studies.  That said, any similar
data can be joined or missing data imputed with these methods.
